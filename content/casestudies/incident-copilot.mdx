# Incident Copilot

Designing a real-time operations assistant that surfaces actionable guidance during an outage call.

## Goals

- Reduce time-to-mitigation.
- Improve responder confidence.
- Capture structured evaluation of suggestions.

## Approach

The system captures transcript chunks, performs lightweight retrieval over known runbooks, and ranks actions via scoring functions.

> Future iterations will integrate deeper reliability metrics and post-incident automated summarization.

## Current Metrics

- Latency: ~420ms median for suggestion generation.
- Coverage: 68% of incident steps receive contextual guidance.
- Accuracy: 74% of suggestions accepted or partially followed.

## Next Steps

1. Add hallucination guardrails.
2. Expand benchmark dataset for unusual incident types.
3. Integrate with evaluation harness for automated regression reports.
