# ADR-0001: Portfolio Architecture

We adopt Next.js (App Router) with Tailwind v4, Shadcn UI, and a verification-first workflow emphasizing evaluation harnesses.

## Rationale

- Modern React features and RSC.
- Tailwind v4 tokens/utilities.
- Clear documentation patterns with MDX.

## Consequences

- Simpler content routing via file system.
- CI includes health verification.
